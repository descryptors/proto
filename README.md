__Proto__ is a collection of UI protoplasm handy for prototyping components for [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) and [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent).


## Building

To build __Proto__ you will need to install [__Clojure CLI tools__](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started).

## Start

```
clj -A:figwheel
```

This will start Figwheel which will build the ClojureScript code. After the compilation is done, open `localhost:5000` in your browser. You can also navigate to `localhost:5000/devcards.html` to use Devcards.
